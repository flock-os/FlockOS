# FlockOS

> *"I am the vine; you are the branches."* — John 15:5

A ministry operating system built on Google Apps Script and Google Sheets — portable, offline-capable, and free to deploy. No subscriptions, no server, no infrastructure. One Google Sheet, one GAS Web App, and a static front-end on GitHub Pages.

---

## What It Is

FlockOS is a full-featured, multi-church ministry platform. A single codebase powers unlimited church deployments, each with independent branding and a separate backend. One unified API endpoint — backed by a 200-tab Google Sheet — handles members, pastoral care, prayer, giving, attendance, events, songs, missions, discipleship, and more.

The front-end is a progressive web app hosted on GitHub Pages. A companion real-time messaging app (**FlockChat**) is hosted separately on Firebase.

## FlockChat — Role & Permission System

FlockChat uses the same 6-level role hierarchy as FlockOS:

| Role | Level | Permissions |
|------|------:|-------------|
| `readonly` | 0 | Read-only access to visible channels |
| `volunteer` | 1 | Post messages, join public channels |
| `care` | 2 | Same as volunteer |
| `leader` | 3 | Create channels (public, private, role-gated) |
| `pastor` | 4 | Admin dashboard — manage users & rooms |
| `admin` | 5 | Full access |

### Channel Access Types

| Type | Behavior |
|------|---------|
| **Public** | Any member can join |
| **Private** | Invite-only; non-members see a "contact an admin" message |
| **Role-Gated** | Requires minimum role; channel is hidden from users below the threshold |

The admin dashboard (Pastor+) has two tabs: **Users** (assign roles, remove members) and **Rooms** (change access type, set minimum role, invite to private channels).

---

## Multi-Church Build System

Each church deployment is driven by a JSON config file in `Scrolls/ChurchRegistry/`.

### Config schema (`Scrolls/ChurchRegistry/ChurchTemplate.json`)

```json
{
  "id": "",
  "name": "",
  "shortName": "",
  "brandName": "",
  "tagline": "Church Management & Ministry Platform",
  "favicon": "",
  "portrait": "",
  "themeColor": "#e8a838",
  "backgroundColor": "#1a1a2e",
  "databaseUrl": "",
  "photosUrl": "",
  "adminEmail": "",
  "analyticsId": "",
  "apps": ["flockos", "flockchat", "atog"],
  "appLinks": {
    "flockos": "Covenant/Courts/TheTabernacle/Pages/index.html",
    "flockchat": "Covenant/Courts/TheFellowship/FlockChat.html?church=<shortname-lower>",
    "atog": "Covenant/Courts/TheUpperRoom/ATOG.html"
  },
  "version": "3.0"
}
```

`apps` controls which cards appear on each church launcher (`Covenant/Nations/<shortName>/index.html`).

`appLinks` is optional and overrides destination URLs for launcher cards. If omitted, build defaults are used.

### Build command

```bash
bash "Running to Jesus/Bezalel/Scripts/A-Build_Churches.sh"
```

### Build + FlockChat deploy (BCP)

```bash
bash "Running to Jesus/Bezalel/Scripts/A-Build_Churches.sh" --deploy-comms
```

This runs the normal church build and then deploys FlockChat hosting to `https://flockos-comms.web.app` via Firebase predeploy packaging.

### What it does

1. Reads each `.json` config in `Covenant/Scrolls/ChurchRegistry/` (skips `ChurchTemplate.json`)
2. Fetches live church configs from the master API and regenerates the Bezalel codex files
3. Copies the source tree into `Covenant/Nations/<shortName>/`
4. Builds a church-specific launcher from the root suite dashboard and includes only configured apps
5. Replaces database URL, tagline, theme/background colors, title, brand text, and manifest per-church

### Active Deployments

| Short Name | Church | URL |
|------------|--------|-----|
| `FlockOS` | FlockOS (default) | `Covenant/Nations/FlockOS/` |
| `GAS` | Google Apps Script | `Covenant/Nations/GAS/` |
| `TBC` | Trinity Baptist Church | `Covenant/Nations/TBC/` |
| `TheForest` | The Forest | `Covenant/Nations/TheForest/` |

### Deployment tree source

`FlockOS_Churches.html` reads deployment metadata from `Covenant/Courts/TheTabernacle/Scripts/builds_codex.js` (hand-maintained JS object — update it alongside any changes to active deployments).

### Adding a new church

1. Copy `ChurchTemplate.json` → `flockos-yourchurch.json` in `Covenant/Scrolls/ChurchRegistry/`
2. Fill in all fields
3. Optionally add a logo to `Covenant/Courts/TheTabernacle/Images/`
4. Run `A-Build_Churches.sh`
5. Commit and push — church is live at `Covenant/Nations/<shortName>/`

---

## Deploying a New Church Backend

Full step-by-step instructions are in `Covenant/Courts/TheTabernacle/Pages/the_pentecost.html`. Short version:

### 1. Create the Google Sheet

Create a Google Sheet named **FlockOS — [Church Name]**. Copy the Sheet ID from the URL.

### 2. Deploy the GAS backend

1. Open the project from within the Sheet (Extensions → Apps Script)
2. Paste the master `Code.gs` source (local-only — see `Architechtural Docs/` on your dev machine) into the Apps Script editor
3. Set `churchName` and `timezone` at the top of the file
4. Run **`setupFlockOS`** — builds all 200 tabs, seeds content, creates the admin account, and installs care email triggers in one run
5. Deploy → **New Deployment → Web App** (Execute as: Me, Who has access: Anyone)
6. Copy the Web App URL into `DEPLOY_CONFIG.churchAppUrl`, then run **`registerChurchUrl`**

### 3. Connect the front-end

Add the Web App URL as `databaseUrl` in the church's JSON config, then run `A-Build_Churches.sh`.
